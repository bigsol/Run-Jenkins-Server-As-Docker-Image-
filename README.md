Preface
For this demo we will use Jenkins as docker container.
Our image is build upon jenkinsci/blueocean

Highlights:
01. Run Jenkins Server
01.01. Docker command in details
02. Test Jenkins Server
02.01. Unlocking Jenkins
02.02. Customizing Jenkins with plugins
02.03. Creating the first administrator user
02.04. Instance Configuration
02.05. Login to Jenkins
03. Start using Jenkins


01. Run Jenkins Server

# Start jenkins server as container
# Run the following command
docker run \
    -u root \
    --rm \
    -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -v ${PWD}/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    jenkinsci/blueocean
    
 <b>01.01. Docker command in details </b>
 * You can skip to the next section if you don't care about the details
 
 docker run \

    # Use root user as the container user
    -u root \
    
    # (Optional) Automatically removes the Docker container when it is shut down. 
    --rm \
    
    #  ( Optional ) Runs the jenkinsci/blueocean container in the background 
    # (i.e. "detached" mode) and outputs the container ID. 
    # If you do not specify this option, then the running Docker log
    # for this container is output in the terminal window.
    -d \

    # Makes (i.e. "publishes") port 8080 of the jenkinsci/blueocean container to
    # port 8080 on the host machine. 
    # The 1st number represents the port on the host while the 
    # 2nd represents the containerâ€™s port. 
    # Therefore, if you specified -p 49001:8080 for this option, you would be
    # accessing Jenkins on your host machine through port 49001.
    -p 8080:8080 \

     # Maps the /var/jenkins_home directory in the container to the local file system. 
    -v ${PWD}/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \

    # /var/run/docker.sock is the Unix socket the Docker daemon listens on by default. 
    # It is used to communicate with the Docker daemon from within a container
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \

    # The image which we are using
    jenkinsci/blueocean
    
    
 02. Test Jenkins Server

Wait for the server to load and than open your browser at port 8080
Wait for Jenkins to display the Login page

02.01. Unlocking Jenkins

![jenkins-login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51197053/136697800-33dac4ba-16c5-4cc3-b157-5d8ae69a0dbd.png)

Now we need to grab the initial password

# Get the initial password
sudo cat ${PWD}/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

02.02. Customizing Jenkins with plugins
After unlocking Jenkins, the Customize Jenkins page appears.
Here you can install any number of useful plugins as part of your initial setup.
Click one of the two options shown:

Install suggested plugins - to install the recommended set of plugins, which are based on most common use cases.
Select plugins to install - to choose which set of plugins to initially install.
When you first access the plugin selection page, the suggested plugins are selected by default.

02.03. Creating the first administrator user
Finally, after customizing Jenkins with plugins, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

When the Create First Admin User page appears, specify the details for your administrator user in the respective fields and click Save and Finish.

02.04. Instance Configuration
Leave this field as as for now
Proceed to next step
When the Jenkins is ready page appears, click Start using Jenkins.
